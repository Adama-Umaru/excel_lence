#  This code uses the openpyxl library to read data from an Excel file named data.xlsx, write data to a new Excel file named output.xlsx, and convert a text file named data.txt to an Excel file named data.xlsx.

# To read data from an Excel file, the code loads the workbook using the load_workbook() function and gets the active sheet using the active attribute. It then iterates over the rows of the sheet using the iter_rows() method and prints each row to the console.

# To write data to an Excel file, the code creates a new workbook using the Workbook() function and gets the active sheet. It then sets the title of the sheet using the title attribute and writes data to the cells using the cell() method. Finally, it saves the workbook to a file using the save() method.

# To convert a text file to an Excel file, the code reads the data from the text file using the read() method and splitting the lines into a list using splitlines(). It then creates a new workbook and gets the active sheet, and iterates over the data using the enumerate() function and writes each line to a cell using the cell() method. Finally, it saves the workbook to a file.

# You can run this code by saving it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., excel_file_io.py) and putting the input files (data.xlsx and data.txt) in the same directory. Then you can run the script by opening a terminal in the directory and typing python excel_file_io.py. The script will read data from data.xlsx, write data to output.xlsx, and convert data.txt to data.xlsx.
